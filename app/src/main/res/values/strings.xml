    <string name="bio"> Hi there! My name is Louise Gabrielle Talip, but
    my friends call me <b>Loys</b>.
    \n\nI like programming and solving puzzles.
    \n\nThe kind where I\'m challenged and taught to think outside the box.
    \n\nI have no idea where this interest came from, I just really like
    the idea of puzzles for some reason.
    \n\nI also like playing different musical instruments, reading books,
    and biking.
    \n\nI am currently 19 years old, taking up BS Computer Science in
    one of the most prestigious universities in the Philippines - the
    University of the Philippines Los Banos.</string>
